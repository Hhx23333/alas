# Getting Started

* When opening the ALAS GUI you will see a number of different functions on the left side. `Setting` and `Reward` are where you can configure how the script runs. In `Setting` you can choose which fleet is the mob fleet or the boss fleet, retirement and enhancing preferences and you even choose what level of ship morale you would like to farm with. In `Reward` you set when the script will collect oil and coins from your canteen and market and mission rewards. You can also tell the script what commissions you would like to run and what tactical training to do. All of the settings here will be used when you select a `function` to farm. Before choosing a `function` to farm, please press `start` to save your `settings`, so if you go to `function` `setting` and modify some things and dont click in `start` nothing there you change will be write on `alas.ini`, and not run ALAS with `alas.ini` opened, this can cause issues when saving changes to the file.

 * The current functions are `Daily` where the script will run your daily missions and hard mode maps of your choice. `Main Campaign` where the script will complete story stages. `Event` where it will run event maps. `7-2 Mystery Farming` will run 7-2 to farm for gold. `12-2 and 12-4 Levelling` will run those maps for exp.

* After you have tweaked your settings and saved them, select a function and press start again and the script will run. For example if you select the `event` function, then press start it will farm an event map of your choice.

* Dont use submarines, When switching the submarine zone, the icon in the strategy don't change because a in-game bug, it's not just to checking `do_not_use` in ALAS, dont have any submarine fleet mounted while using the ALAS.
